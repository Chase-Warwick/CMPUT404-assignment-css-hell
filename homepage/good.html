        <p>
            When I was young, I always had a knack for problem solving and a love for technology
            often helping family members and friends with IT related issues. I would trouble shoot
            problems determined to get at the core of the issue. As I came into my formative years,
            I discovered a passion for sicence and mathematics which I believe was an extension of 
            that nature I had when I was younger. As I grew into adulthood I delved further into my interested
            through my attendance at the University of Alberta where I studied Computing Science with a minor
            in Mathematics. The prospect of a lifelong career in which learning is an asset has always been
            a big part of why I wanted to go into software.
